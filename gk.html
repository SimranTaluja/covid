        <h1><u>Covid Preventions</u></h1>
            <h2>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h2>
            <ul><li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
            <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
            <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell</li>
            <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li></ul>

            <h1><u>Covid Treatments</u></h1>
            <h2>Self-care</h2>
            <p> If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other 
                family members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
                Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact
                with loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and attention from adults during difficult times. 
                Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.
                It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family,
                can help. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor.
                </p>
            <h2>Medical treatments</h2>
            <p>If you have mild symptoms and are otherwise healthy, self-isolate and contact your medical provider or a COVID-19 
                information line for advice.
                Seek medical care if you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing. Call in advance.
                </p>

        <h1><u>How to differentiate between COVID 19 and flu?</u></h1>
            <h2>Similarities:</h2>
            <ul><li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
            <li>Cough</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>Fatigue (tiredness)</li>
            <li>Sore throat</li>
            <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
            <li>Muscle pain or body aches</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults</li></ul>

            <h2>Differences:</h2>
            <ul><li>COVID-19 and the flu have several differences. COVID-19 and the flu are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is 
                caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, while influenza is caused by influenza A and B viruses.</li>
            <li>Symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu appear at different times and have some differences. With COVID-19, you may experience 
                loss of taste or smell. COVID-19 symptoms generally appear two to 14 days after exposure. Flu symptoms usually appear 
                about one to four days after exposure. COVID-19 appears to be more contagious and to spread more quickly than the flu. 
                Severe illness such as lung injury may be more frequent with COVID-19 than with influenza. The mortality rate also 
                appears to be higher with COVID-19 than the flu.</li>
            <li>COVID-19 can cause different complications from the flu, such as blood clots and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in 
                children.</li>
            <li>Another difference is that the flu can be treated with antiviral drugs. No antiviral drugs are currently approved to 
                treat COVID-19. Researchers are evaluating many drugs and treatments for COVID-19. Some drugs may help reduce the 
                severity of COVID-19.</li>
            <li>You can get an annual flu vaccine to help reduce your risk of the flu. The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity 
                of the flu and the risk of serious complications. Each year's flu vaccine provides protection from the three or four 
                influenza viruses that are expected to be the most common during that year's flu season. The vaccine can be given as 
                a shot (injection) or as a nasal spray.</li>
            <li>The flu vaccine doesn't protect you from getting COVID-19. Research also shows that getting the flu vaccine does not 
                make you more likely to get COVID-19 or other respiratory infections.</li>
            <li>No vaccine is currently available for the virus that causes COVID-19. But researchers are working to develop vaccines 
                to prevent COVID-19.</li></ul>
